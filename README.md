# Library-Management-System

Description: 
This project demonstrates a standalone application, which is used to maintain the records of a library and can be accessed by both customer and librarian. This is based on file handling in C++. The data is retrieved from files and inserted into an AVL Tree for easier searching.

It involves maintaining the database for entering new books and issuing books with respective due dates. It is also useful in checking availability of stocks and updating them regularly. Customers can also avail membership.

Languages Used: C++

Text files used:
1. "book_list1.txt"
		This contains the list of books available in the library with details such as author, publisher, price, quantity, etc.
2. "books_input.txt"
		This is an empty text file. The books bought by customers will be automatically appended to this file.
2. "suggestions.txt"
		This is an empty text file. The feedback given by the customers will be appended to this file.
